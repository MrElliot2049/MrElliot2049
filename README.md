# Welcome to the Edge of the Future, I'm Adamya Chauhan 🚀

**In a world where deepfakes blur the line between truth and lies, I’m on a mission to unmask the deception.**  
Like a replicant searching for its identity, I dive deep into **Deep Learning** to uncover hidden truths. I'm currently focused on **Deepfake Detection** and unraveling the mysteries of **Neural Networks**.

## 💻 The Project: **Deepfake Detection – Unmasking the Illusions**

> *"You can’t tell the difference anymore... They’re out there..."*

### 🔍 **The Truth Behind the Mask**  

In this project, I’m developing a **deepfake detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**. The goal is to expose the fabricated world of manipulated videos and prevent the chaos that lies within.  
With **Python** and advanced **deep learning** algorithms, I extract frames from videos, analyze them, and separate **real from fake**.

This is my pursuit of truth in a world full of simulations.
